# CubeSat-Prototype
This project is a new tool for education and demonstrations. It can be used in a classroom or training setting to introduce the basics of cube satellites, or it can be a stepping stone in a project to build and launch an actual CubeSat into space. Which demonstrates all the major subsystems of a satellite. The project includes a definition, declaration and design of CubeSat prototype including on board computer subsystem, ADCS subsystem, Electrical Power SubSystem in addition to ground station simulator. The project guaranteed sending and receiving data between ground station and satellite with high accuracy due to the used error checking mechanism.
